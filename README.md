Small example on how to pull Uploads from GMBN channel feed
Make sure you have Youtube Data API key and its stored in gradle.properties under user directory
Name it "YoutubeData" so it will be picked up durting build time

//TODO: Implement pagination logic for endless scroll (possibly Paging Library), Unit Tests.

In the future i plan to add bottom navigation tabs to give ability to swtich between differnt channels e.g. GMBN, GCN etc.
